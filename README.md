# DeepLearning-with-TensorFlow

### House Prices Estimator
-> Developed a deep neural network using TensorFlow and trained it to estimate house prices with relation to the number of bedrooms that the house has.
-> Used #squared_mean_error as loss function and #(stochastic gradient descent) as the optimizer function since this problem is a linear regression problem.
-> Used Jupyter Notebook on Google Colaboratory to train and test the neural network.
