# DeepLearning-with-TensorFlow

### House Prices Estimator
-> Developed a deep neural network using TensorFlow and trained it to estimate house prices with relation to the number of bedrooms that the house has.

-> Used <b>squared_mean_error</b> as loss function and stochastic gradient descent as the optimizer function since this problem is a linear regression problem.

-> Used Jupyter Notebook on Google Colaboratory to train and test the neural network.
